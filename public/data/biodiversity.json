Tabonucos send out root grabs, catching on to their neighbors until, after many years, the whole stand is united and deeply entrenched in the ground. Though intense wind speeds can rip away their leaves, the trees, some of the tallest in the forest, are incredibly sturdy.

The forest smells sweet, like warm soil, and the gases let off by busy soil microbes."

The winds blew around the empty skeleton of the greenhouse, and the trenches around his fields gathered the water and prevented runoff of the soil Pagan spent three years cultivating.

But Pagan had too much at stake to take any chances."

After the hurricane, other farmers waited in 10-hour lines to get gas to fill their tractors, but Pagan’s tractors ran on grass, and occupied themselves during the storm munching on breadfruit from a fallen tree nearby.

Pagan, who did his master’s thesis at University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez on organic methods of soil recovery, could place his young crops in the rich brown earth as soon as they were big enough to come out of the greenhouse."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "value": "Pagan’s recovery paralleled that of El Yunque--both places built their regrowth on animals, sunlight, water and other resources that didn’t need to come in from overseas.

      "value": "He hopes this self-sufficiency will also change the conventional agriculture systems that colonialism imposed on the island. Ever since the Spanish claimed Puerto Rico in 1493, most of the island’s agricultural land has been devoted to the demands of export markets, with coffee, sugar and tobacco plantations pushing out subsistence farmers and causing a decline in the amount food Puerto Rican farmers produced for on-island consumption. In recent years, young farmers like Pagan have been trying to shift the island to more sustainable practices -- installing rain barrels, saving seeds and cultivating compost, all measures that reduce the need for the outside inputs that became so scarce after the hurricane."
