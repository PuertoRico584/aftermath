The island currently imports 80-85 percent of its food. In recent years, young farmers like Pagan have been trying to shift the island to more sustainable practices -- installing rain barrels, saving seeds and cultivating compost, all measures that reduce the need for the outside inputs that became so scarce after the hurricane."
