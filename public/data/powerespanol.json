Orlando Ochoa Méndez is exhausted, hunched over his friends in the middle of the dance floor, but his tired brown eyes flicker to life when he realizes how late it is. He says frantic goodbyes, quick kisses on both cheeks flying through the air as he bolts out of Fábrica de Arte Cubano, a warehouse now transformed into one of Havana’s most well-known nightclubs. He scans the street for a taxi, his dark skin no longer livened by blankets of blue and green light from inside the club — everything feels dim now that he’s competing with the clock. Orlando chooses a classic Cuban ride, a baby blue Chevy born in 1956, somehow finding the driver who’s an old friend — or maybe they’re meeting for the first time, with Orlando you’re never quite sure. “Llevame a la lanchita de Regla,” he tells the driver."

The star that pinpoints Havana as the country’s capital on any given map of Cuba stamps right over the harbor that divides these two areas. But these regions cannot be so simply merged — the star extinguishes Regla’s individuality, its smokestacks that hint at its industrial past, its streets blemished with missing chunks of cement and its homes stained with soot. There’s less urgency on this side of the harbor; in Regla, time is a suggestion of sorts. Orlando knows that while the final ferry home is always scheduled to leave Havana’s port at 12:15 a.m., the ferry driver often decides to leave at whatever time will get him home fastest, even if it’s the wrong one."

The United States? The questions come mostly from older people, ones who feel worlds apart from the Facebook fanatics now flocking to their country.
