              <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
              <p class="info">Coal ash is produced by burning coal in power plants for electricity. Coal is burned, producing steam to power turbines that provide electricity. Coal ash is the byproduct of the burning process.
              <br><br><strong>Fact:</strong> In 2012, 270 coal plants generated 110 million tons of coal ash in the United States.

              <p class="info">Often, even with proper storage, coal ash will leak into its surrounding environment.  Rain water can cause the spread of coal ash through the ground and contaminate groundwater sources like aquifers.  If the ash is left uncovered, heavy winds can blow it to nearby areas of settlement.  Natural disasters especially pose a risk to the spread of coal ash.</p>

              <h2>Puerto Rico Facts</h2>
              <p class="info">Since 2002, the business AES Puerto Rico has produced between 400 and 1,600 tons of coal ash waste daily by producing energy with coal. Between 2004 and 2011, approximately 2 million tons of ash, or 4 billion pounds of ash, were deposited around Puerto Rico by the AES Puerto Rico plant. The deposits of ash were used as filler in urban centers and highways in Guayama, San Juan, Dorado, Toa Alta, Caguas, Juncos, Ponce, Santa Isabel, Coamo, Arroyo and Mayaguez.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="info">The community of Arroyo Barril protested against the coal ash coming from AES Puerto Rico located in Guayama, Puerto Rico. According to the community, after the events of the coal ash depositing, the community presented problems of skin health, birth defects and spontaneous abortion.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="info">AES argues that they are not toxic waste and that they are safe for citizens and the environment.</p>
