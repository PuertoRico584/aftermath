            <p class="info">You're trying to collect your items and assess the damage done to your property. You still have
              your car. Check. You still have your roof. Check. You know your neighbors around you might not have been so
              lucky.</p>

            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <p class="info">You're told it may take a while for your power to come back on, which is expected. You just went
              through this with Hurricane Irma, so nothing new here. You begin using lanterns to get around your house at
              night. During the day, you're still expected to be at work where you are assisting those in the community who
              cannot help themselves. You have canned food saved up for your meals. You still have your car, which means you
              sit in it while it charges your phone so you can receive updates from friends and family.</p>

            <h2>Month 2</h2>
            <p class="info">Living without power has become more of a struggle. Everytime you make it out to the store for
              batteries or a simple fan, it is sold out. You have your family in mainland U.S. send you some supplies. You
              invest in a gas grill to heat your food which sets you back. Especially since you now have to buy a new propane
              tank. You've gotten better at cooking because every time you cook too much, it must be given to the dog or
              thrown out.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="project04" class="project">
            <h2>Month 4</h2>
            <p class="info">You're still holding out on buying that expensive generator with the hopes that the power will be
              restored to your neighborhood any day now, just like the government has told you. You continue to carry
              lanterns around during the mornings and nights. You do, however, sleep a lot because once it's dark, there is no
              point in staying up.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="project05" class="project">
            <h2>Month 6</h2>
            <p class="info">You finally cave a buy a generator, setting you back with the cost of the machine and the gas it
              uses. You now have power for 4 - 6 hours each day to complete chores. Soon after you buy this generator, the AEE
              restores power to your neighborhood. You finally buy a fridge and stock it with fresh food. The power begins to
              go in and out, causing you to resort to more non-perishable foods and lanterns from time to time.</p>
