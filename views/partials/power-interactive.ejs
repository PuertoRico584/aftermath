            <h2>Day 1</h2>
            <p class="info">You begin to assess the damage done to your property. You still have
              your car. You still have your roof. You know your neighbors around you might not have been so
              lucky.</p>

            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <p class="info">You're told it may take a while for your power to come back on, which is expected. You just went
              through this with Hurricane Irma, so nothing new here. You begin using battery-powered lanterns to get around your house at
              night. During the day, you are expected to be at work where you are assisting those in the community who
              cannot help themselves. You have canned food saved up for your meals. You luckily have your car, which means you
              sit in it while it charges your phone so you can receive updates from friends and family.</p>

            <h2>Month 2</h2>
            <p class="info">Living without power has become more of a struggle. Every time you venture out to the store for
              batteries or a simple fan, you come home empty-handed since they are sold out. You have your family in mainland U.S. send you some supplies. You
              invest in a gas grill to heat your food which sets you back financially since you now have to buy a propane
              tank. You've gotten better at cooking because every time you cook too much, it must be given to the dog or
              thrown out.</p>

        <div id="project04" class="project">
            <h2>Month 4</h2>
            <p class="info">You're still holding out on buying that expensive generator with the hopes that the power will be
              restored to your neighborhood any day now, just like the government has told you. You continue to carry
              lanterns around during the mornings and nights. You do, however, sleep a lot because once it's dark, there is
              little else to do.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="project05" class="project">
            <h2>Month 6</h2>
            <p class="info">You finally cave and buy a generator, costing over $1,000 plus the gas it
              uses. You now have power for 4 - 6 hours each day to complete chores, cool your home and refrigerate your food.
              Soon after you buy this generator, the AEE restores power to your neighborhood. You finally buy a fridge and
              stock it with fresh food. The power continues to go in and out, causing you to resort to more non-perishable foods
              and lanterns from time to time, but it's progress.</p>

              <p class="intro-par">Recovery after Hurricane Maria has become one of the longest efforts for the island for many factors other
                than the strength of the storm. Things like pre-exisiting problems paired with Hurricane Irma hitting Puerto
                Rico just days before Maria has left the to-do list longer than ever. While the citizens of the island repair
                and try to return to normal, there are still lingering problems holding them back and slowing the process. Many
                worry repairs will not be completed until the 2018 hurricane season begins, starting the process all over again.</p>
